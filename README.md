# StarfishDAOs


## Project positioning
StarfishDAO is a DAO creation platform that allows anyone to create a simple DAO organization using StarfishDAO.
## Solve what problem
### Low expansibility
At present, many DAO tool products generally have the characteristics of low expansibility, and cannot achieve function iteration and upgrade, which directly restricts the development of DAO organizations.

### Low compatibility
At present, many DAO tool products generally have the characteristics of low compatibility. There is no unified api interface or unified development document between each other, which can not be effectively compatible, and even more can not realize the role of collaborative governance.

### Low diversity
At present, many DAO tool products generally have the characteristics of low diversity. Most products can only meet some general functions, and cannot meet the diversified and differentiated needs of the DAO organization.

## characteristic

- The DAO protocol itself and all levels of DAOs are decentralized;

- The DAO protocol is a set of open protocols that can interact with internal modules and external protocols.

- The DAO protocol can be used by different types of people. We always want to build the RainbowDAO protocol into a workable, growing and warm one;
